1. How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?
About three days.

2. Describe what you did to solve your chosen challenge problem.

I choose the "Unix-style exec implementation" challenge.

The exec() code is almost the same to the spawn() code. It first
create a child environment, and configure it according to the 
father environment, set it stack and copy the code to the 
corresponding address. Then at the end of spawn(), call the 
sys_exec_set_status(). It destroy the curenv(parent environment), 
and set the curenv to the child environment, and set it RUNNABLE.

You can test my code by remove the quotation in the ‘lib/spawn.c’:
// #define UNIX_EXEC
